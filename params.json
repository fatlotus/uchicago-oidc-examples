{"name":"UChicago OIDC Examples","tagline":"Reference CNetID-authenticated applications written using OpenID Connect.","body":"### OpenID Connect Example Code\r\n\r\nThis code contains three basic applications, all written in Python, and using\r\nthe excellent Flask microframework. They each advance the following goals:\r\n\r\n1. The **basic application** (`basic_client.py`) verifies access and displays\r\n   basic profile information;\r\n2. The **authorizing application** (`api_client.py`) verifies access and\r\n   retrieves more information from a campus API; and\r\n3. The **authorized API** (`api_server.py`) verifies access and serves\r\n   data to authorized applications.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure where to start, begin with the first.\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\nIn order to run these examples, you will need to register the application at\r\nthe production OpenID Connect server:\r\n\r\n1. Visit `https://openidcdev.uchicago.edu`.\r\n2. Click on \"Self-Service Client Registration.\"\r\n3. Enter \"`https://localhost:5000`\" for the Redirect URI, and click Submit.\r\n4. Make note of the client ID and secret, and replace the values in config.py.\r\n\r\nNext, install the Flask and requests modules. This can be done by running-\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n-in a terminal. Finally, launch the application-\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python basic_client.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n-and visit `http://localhost:5000` in a web browser.\r\n\r\n#### License\r\n\r\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\r\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\r\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\r\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\r\nsoftware to the public domain.
